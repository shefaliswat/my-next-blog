title: 'My first Nextjs app'
name: 'This post contains all about how I created a simple blog application using Next.js '
content: 'I had worked on an existing Nextjs application before but did not get a chance to build one from scratch. Then, I came across this super easy youtube tutorial by Dave Gray (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puIQhnjOfbc) where he has easily explained step by step how to build a simple blog application. I am still new to Nextjs so this app is still work in progress, but hoping to learn more and add new features soon.'
